Warehouse Management Program for a small-scale company, structured in 3 levels: Warehouse > Section > Bin, with two main processes:

1. Inbound Process (Receiving Stock)
The Purchasing Staff creates a Purchase Order (PO) to order goods from the supplier.

Based on the PO, they generate one or more Delivery Orders (DO) that include the quantity and expected delivery date. The total quantity in all DOs must not exceed the original PO.

The Warehouse Staff receives and checks the goods according to the DO and places them in a staging area.

From there, they create a Transfer Request to move goods into their designated storage locations.

The Warehouse Manager reviews and confirms the Transfer Requests. Once goods are stored in the warehouse, the inbound process is completed.

2. Stocktaking Process (Inventory Check)
The Warehouse Manager schedules a stocktake by selecting specific bins and items to check, and marks them as “frozen” (cannot be purchased or received during this time).

The Warehouse Staff conducts the physical count and records the quantities.

If discrepancies are found, the Manager performs a recount and confirms the final quantity by clearing the difference.

The items return to active status, and the stocktaking process ends.
